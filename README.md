# wurstGPT

WurstGPT is a learning companion for German language learners. Every day it will send you an email with 5 randomly sampled words from a list of the 1000 most common German words along their translation and 5 example sentences generated by ChatGPT.

### Dataset

I used a [Quizlet study set](https://quizlet.com/28209380/top-10000-german-words-by-frequency-1-1000-flash-cards/) containing the 1000 most common German words. I manually exported the set as a CSV file and saved it as `quizlet.csv` in the `data` folder.
